This is an Orange plugin for accessing Indicator API from world bank data.

This plugin is an extension of the simple_wbd_ API helper.

The API in this plugin is made to fetch data as easily as possible, for that
some advanced API filters are disabled. The goal here is to get as much data
with as little code as possible. For a more comprehensive API helper for World
Bank Data see wbpy_ and wbdata_.
